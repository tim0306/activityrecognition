Thank you for downloading TKAnnotator! This software can be used to annotate a dataset using
a bluetooth headset. By combining the microsoft speech api with the widcomm bluetooth API, the 
program is able to detect the push of a button on the headset after which it starts to listen
for sentences it can recognize. This package contains the following files:

TKAnnotator.exe - Main program executable
btwapi.dll - widcomm library containing bluetooth functions
LogActivity.xml - Grammar file for the speech recognition engine

The grammar file LogActivity.xml can be edited to your preferences to define what type of annotation
the program should detect. For details on how this file should be formatted, please refer to
the microsoft speech api documentation.

Enjoy using this program, for any questions or suggestions please email: T.L.M.vanKasteren@uva.nl
The source code will be send to you upon request.
